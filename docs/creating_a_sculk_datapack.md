# Creating a Sculk Datapack

Sculk datapacks are like regular datapacks with minor differences.

The folder structure looks like this

```
Datapack Name/
    data/
        sculk/
            tags/
                scripts/
                    load.json
                    tick.json
        namespace/
            scripts/
                load.sk
                tick.sk
    pack.mcmeta
```
